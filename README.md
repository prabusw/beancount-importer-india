# Importers
## Importer for Zerodha

This is an importer for csv formatted tradebook from Indian stock
broker Zerodha. Every decent broker in India, gives similar tradebook.
So this importer can work almost for every broker who provides
tradebook in csv format.

As of Jan'2025 the csv formatted tradebook downloaded from Zerodha has
the following fields:

```
symbol,isin,trade_date,exchange,segment,series,trade_type,auction,quantity,price,trade_id,order_id,order_execution_time
```
Just ensure that the csv file is named as zerodhaNNNNNNNN.csv
format. For example, zerodha20232024.csv is a valid filename.

In beangulp, the importers are called by an import_XXX.py which has
replaced the config.py files used earlier.
The actual ledger can be like my.beancount.
