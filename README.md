## Importer for Zerodha

This is an importer for csv formatted tradebook from Indian stock
broker Zerodha. Every decent broker in India, gives similar tradebook.
So this importer can work almost for every broker who provides
tradebook in csv format.

As of Jan'2025 the csv formatted tradebook downloaded from Zerodha has
the following fields:

```
symbol,isin,trade_date,exchange,segment,series,trade_type,auction,quantity,price,trade_id,order_id,order_execution_time
```
Just ensure that the csv file is named as zerodhaNNNNNNNN.csv
format. For example, zerodha20232024.csv is a valid filename.


## Importer for Banks

The importer script icici.py can be used to handle the csv formatted
file which can be generated by the xls2csv tool from catdoc package.

The original headers in the file downloaded from ICICBank has the
following columns.

```
S No.	Value Date	Transaction Date	Cheque Number	Transaction Remarks	Withdrawal Amount (INR )	Deposit Amount (INR )	Balance (INR )
```

When downloading SBI transaction statements, if xls is choosen, the
file will be in tsv format even though the file will get downloaded
with .xls extension. Use the tsv2csv.sh script in tools folder to
convert this to csv format.

Almost all the other bank importers like IOB and KVB work with the csv
file(s) downloaded from their respective bank website, without any
modification.

If the downloaded csv has the account number in it, then use it in
your importer config file.

## Using the Importers

The command(linux) to use beangulp to identify, extract and archive is
given below.

```
$./import_prabu.py [option] Downloads/
where option can be identify|extract|archive
```
Depending on the number of matching csv files available in Downloads
folder, the beancount formatted output will be displayed one by
one. You can redirect it to new txt file and copy paste it later to
my.beancount.
